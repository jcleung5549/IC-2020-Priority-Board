Common Platforms Concept.   

Need for “operationally similar” variations of compute platforms where the physical and interface operations are the same, but offer options for different processors, NUMA (or non) designs, and common peripherals.   A 'few' common platforms would be necessary to provide scalable, efficient packaging for various DC's and operators (rack scale, 19" compatible, and edge appliances).  

Core count, memory capacity, and IO bandwidth improves in either

 1) incremental, evolutionary steps  or 

2) disruptive & revolutionary phases.   supported by major releases of the operating systems.
