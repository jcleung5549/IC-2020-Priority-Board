Standardized interfaces protect investments and support technology adoption. Operators need consistent remote management command and control with CPU agnostic root-of-trust support from discrete devices and/or embedded functions. 

 

AI, ML, and DNN applications are driving demand for hardware accelerators delivering 10x to 1000x performance improvement versus GP processors or software solution. 

New domain/workload specific HW accelerators will place new requirements on the baseboard (new IO interfaces and memory buses, different mechanical and power envelopes for mezzanine and option cards). Ongoing network transitions driving new i/f standards, & time of deployment configuration needs.
